# Topic 3: Relation Extraction Advanced Question and Challenges


## Given Questions

**(Q1):** RE differs from classical classification tasks in that information about the relation candidates (the two entities in question) also needs to be modeled. How would you construct such a machine learning model for a RE task?

**(Q2)** How would you leverage graphs (e.g. Universal Dependency trees) into your solution (idea: use paths between the entities as features)?

**(Q3) Advanced question:** In many popular NLP tasks (also in RE), the state-of-the-art so- lutions usually capture the meaning of the text by leveraging neural language models that are based on the Transformer architecture Vaswani et al., 2017 (e.g. BERT Devlin et al., 2019. While achieving state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks, these solutions are usually hard to interpret, and we treat them as black-box. An interesting research question would be to develop a white-box solution using semantic graphs and interpretable graph patterns. The POTATO library provides tools for extracting and developing graph patterns for text- classification tasks. In this task, the student could also use and compare different semantic parsers and how they fare against each other on the problem.

**(Q4) Advanced question:** The CrowdTruth and the FoodDisease datasets contain the same labels and similar entity types. How do modern neural based models (e.g. BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)) transfer their knowledge between the datasets? Do rule-based models transfer better?



## Choosen Question: Q4

Modern neural-based models like BERT use a technique called transfer learning to transfer their knowledge between two similar datasets. Transfer learning is a process in which a model that has been trained on one task is fine-tuned on a different but related task. For example, a BERT model that has been trained on a large dataset of general text can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of domain-specific text, such as legal documents or medical reports. This allows the model to utilize the knowledge it has already learned about the structure and patterns of language to perform better on the new task. Additionally, BERT can also be fine-tuned with the new dataset to provide a more accurate prediction for the specific task.

### Transfer Learning in BERT:

Transfer learning is a technique in which a model that has been trained on one task is used as a starting point to solve a different but related task. This approach is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) where large amounts of labeled data can be difficult to obtain.

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a neural-based model that has been pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data. This pre-training allows BERT to learn the general structure and patterns of language, which can then be fine-tuned on smaller, domain-specific datasets. This fine-tuning process allows BERT to utilize its pre-trained knowledge to perform well on new tasks, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.

For example, a BERT model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset of general text can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of legal documents. This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to the specific language and terminology used in legal documents, resulting in improved performance on tasks such as legal document classification.

In summary, transfer learning with BERT allows us to leverage the knowledge learned from a large pre-training dataset to improve performance on smaller, related tasks, and reduce the amount of labeled data required for training.


### Rule based models in NLP:

In natural language processing (NLP), a rule-based system uses a set of pre-defined rules to process and analyze natural language input. These rules can be based on grammar, syntax, or semantic relationships between words. The system applies these rules to the input text, in order to perform tasks such as language translation, text summarization, or sentiment analysis. Rule-based systems can be simple and easy to implement, but may struggle with handling exceptions or understanding context. They are often used as a starting point for developing more advanced, machine learning-based NLP systems.


### Is BERT a rule-based model?

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is not a rule-based model. BERT is a pre-trained transformer-based neural network model for natural language processing tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, and language generation.

Unlike rule-based systems, BERT is trained using a large corpus of text data, and is able to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases in a language without being explicitly programmed with grammar or syntax rules. BERT's training allows it to understand the context of a word in a sentence, making it more robust to handle exceptions and variations in language. This allows BERT to perform complex NLP tasks with high accuracy.

### Do rule-based models transfer better?

Rule-based models are typically not designed for transfer learning. In some cases, a rule-based model may perform well on two similar datasets for a specific NLP task, such as relation extraction. This is because the model can be hand-tuned to the specific task and datasets, and the rules can be adjusted to account for the similarities and differences between the two datasets.

However, rule-based models may struggle when the datasets are significantly different, or when the task becomes more complex. This is because rule-based models may not be able to generalize well to new data, and require manual adjustments to the rules for each new dataset. Additionally, rule-based models may be limited by the set of rules that are predefined and may fail to capture subtle variations in the data.

In comparison, machine learning models, such as neural networks, are able to learn patterns and relationships in the data and can generalize well to new datasets. These models are able to automatically adjust to the variations in the data, making them more robust and accurate.

In conclusion, rule-based models can work well on similar datasets for specific NLP tasks such as relation extraction, but they may struggle with more complex tasks and different datasets. Machine learning models can be more generalizable and robust.
